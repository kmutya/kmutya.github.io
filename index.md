**Data Science. Jnana Yoga. Dhyāna. Nature. Fitness.**

I like how data science can be used to understand the nature of reality. I have an academic and professional background in Operations Research and Applied Statistics. I currently work at Google.

I am interested in Upanishads and Āstika Darśana's, particularly: Vedanta, Nyāyá, Vaiśeṣika and Yoga. I like reading, writing and contemplating on them.

I like biking, hiking, weight training and bouldering.

I try to practise ahimsa in all forms: which entails food preference (Vegan), shopping ethically and sustainably.
