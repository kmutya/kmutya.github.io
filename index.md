**I like to understand things deeply and clearly** and perfer an "applied-theoretic" approach. This usually entails, using theory and computations to my advantage.

I started this blog during my Graduate Studies to bring order and structure to my thoughts.

Apart from Math, I am also fascinated by Indian Philosphy particular questions relating to Atman (self), try to lead a sattvic lifestyle, maintain a low carbon footprint and quite contradictorily love strength training.
