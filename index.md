I like to understand things deeply and clearly. In order to accomplish this, I start by formally defining the initial idea and then convert it into working code. Along the way, I try to make use of mathematical visualizations to augument my understanding. Post that, I love to apply my understanding to solve interesting problems.

I started this blog during my Graduate Studies to bring order and structure to my thoughts.

Apart from Math, I am also fascinated by Indian Philosphy particular questions relating to Atman (self), try to lead a sattvic lifestyle, maintain a low carbon footprint and quite contradictorily love strength training.
