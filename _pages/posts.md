### Nonlinear Programming: Methods for Unconstrained Optimization

Nonlinear Optimization sits at the heart of modern Machine Learning. For a practioner, due to the profusion of well built packages, NLP has reduced to playing with hyperparameters. This post talks illustrates the 'Hello World' of nonlinear optimization theory: Unconstrained Optimization. We look at some basic theory followed by python implementations and loss surface visualizations. <br>

### Maximum Clique Problem as an LP

Maximum Clique Problem was one of the 21 original NP-hard problems enumerated by Richard Karp in 1972. This post models it using a Linear Programming approach. In particular, we reduce the clique problem to an Independent set problem and solve it by appying linear relaxation and column generation. <br>
