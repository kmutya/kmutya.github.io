# Conceptual


## Nonlinear Programming: Methods for Unconstrained Optimization

Here, I catalog some basic theory followed by numpy/scipy based implementations and loss surface visualizations. <br>

## Dimensionality Reduction

Here, I approach dimensionality reduction from a projection-optimization point of view, followed by raw numpy implementations. <br>

# Applied

## Maximum Clique Problem as an LP

Maximum Clique Problem was one of the 21 original NP-hard problems enumerated by Richard Karp in 1972. Here, I model it using a Linear Programming approach. In particular, reduce the clique problem to an Independent set problem and solve it by appying linear relaxation and column generation. <br>
