# Applied

## Maximum Clique Problem as an LP

Maximum Clique Problem was one of the 21 original NP-hard problems enumerated by Richard Karp in 1972. Here, I model it using a Linear Programming approach. In particular, reduce the clique problem to an Independent set problem and solve it by appying linear relaxation and column generation. <br>
