### Nonlinear Programming: Methods for Unconstrained Optimization

This post talks about different variants of unconstrained optimization algorithms along with their implementation and visulization. <br>

### Maximum Clique Problem as an LP

Maximum Clique Problem was one of the 21 original NP-hard problems enumerated by Richard Karp in 1972. This post models it using a Linear Programming approach. In particular, we reduce the clique problem to an Independent set problem and solve it by appying linear relaxation and column generation. <br>
