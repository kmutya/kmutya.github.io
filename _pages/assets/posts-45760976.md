Based on a colleagues recommendation, I recently came across [1] which provides a great introduction in clarifying some nuances within the classical probability POV by highlighting it's connections with Measure Theory. I wanted to understand more about this measure theoretic POV of probability and hence starting reading [2]. Here, I catalog some of my thoughts.

# Connection with Measure Theory

[2] perfectly sums up the connection between measure theory and probability theory using the above table. We can disect this table to enhance our understanding from both these perspectives. For convenience, we will use abbrevations: PT - for classical probability theory and MT - for measure theory treatment of probability.

We will be using [3] as reference for PT and [2] as reference for MT. For convenience, I will not be citing them over and over again, since it is understood. However, while using quotations, I will cite them explicitly. Other references will be citied explicitly.

## PT

<u>Exepriment, Sample Space:</u> Traditionally, we use the notion of an **experiment** to define a sample space.
We consider an experiment to be non-deterministic but it's set of all outcomes to be known. This known set of all possible outcomes is defined as the **sample space.** Common notations are $$S, \Omega$$. Naturally, $$S^c = \emptyset$$.

<u>Event</u> $$(E)$$: Any subset of the sample space is defined as an **event**. If the outcome of our experiment ends up in an event $$E$$, then we can deterministically state that $$E$$ has occured.

<u>Probability:</u> Here, probability is defined using an axiomatic approach. We assume that for each event in the sample there exists a probability, $$P(E)$$. Thereafter, we assume that each of these probabilities satisy a set of intuitive axioms. The three axioms are as follows:

1. $$P(S) = 1$$

2. $$0 \geq P(E) \leq 1$$

3. For mutually exclusive events, $$P(\bigcup_{i}E_i) = \sum_{i}P(E_i)$$ - countable additivity.

Now, **probability is formally defined as the limiting proportion of time $$E$$ occurs**:

$$
P(E) = lim_{n \rightarrow \inf} \frac{n(E)}{n}
$$

Due to the above defined axioms, we know for a fact that this value converges to a constant.

<u>Random Variable:</u> is defined as "a real valued function on the sample sapce" [3] .

## MT

Ideally, we would like to have a function that maps a value from a given set to a number. i.e $$\mu: X \rightarrow number \ni X \in R^n and \ number \in [0,\inf]$$ adhering to certain properties.

However, this is not possible due to the presense of certain strange subsets in $$R^n$$. Therefore, instead of describing this function for all subsets of $$R^n$$ we constrain it to a certain class of subsets within $$R^n$$. This class is known as $$\sigma$$-algebra.

$$\sigma$$<u>-algebra:</u> Let $$X$$ be a nonempty set, an **algebra** is a non empty collection of subsets of X that is closed under finte unions and complements. A **$$\sigma$$-algebra** is an algebra that is closed under countable unions.

<u>Measure, Measureable Space, Measureable Sets:</u> - Now, a measure for a set $$X$$ equipped with a $$\sigma$$-algebra $$\mathcal{M}$$, i.e $$(X,\mathcal{M})$$ - **measureable space**, is a function $$\mu: \mathcal{M} \rightarrow [0,inf]$$ such that:
  - i. $$\mu(\emptyset) = 0$$
  - ii. Countable additivity for a sequence of disjoint sets in $$\mathcal{M}$$.

$$(X,\mathcal{M},\mu)$$ is called a **measure space**. Set's in $$\mathcal{M}$$ are called **measureable sets**, $$E \in \mathcal{M}$$.

Now, a small detour to build some intuition.

Let's suppose we are 4 years of age and are given a box full of books. We are now asked to count the no. of books in that box. How do we do it? We simply open the box, think of each book as a constant value say natural number 1 and add up all occurences of this constant. Using measure-theoretic notions, we can define this process formally as follows:
say we have $$(X,\mathcal{M})$$, $$f:X \rightarrow 1$$, $$\mu(E) = \sum_{x \in E} f(x)$$ where $$E \in \mathcal{M}$$. This measure, is called a **counting** measure. Pretty intuitive.

Now, say we were asked how many books in the box have an orange cover. How do we count that? This time, we assign the constant value 1 to only those books that have an orange cover and 0 to all other books. Formally, for the same setting say we have some $$x_0 \in X$$ then $$f(x_0) = 1$$ and $$f(x) = 0 \forall x \neq x_0$$. Then $$\mu$$ is called a **point mass or Dirac measure.**


Now, how can we define probability using this framework?

<u>Probability:</u> can simply be defined as a special type of measure.
Let $$(\Omega, \mathcal{B})$$ be a measureable space.
Let $$A$$ be the set's in $$\mathcal{B}$$. Let $$P$$ be a function $$P: \mathcal{B} \rightarrow R$$ such that:
- $$P(A) \geq 0 \forall A \in \mathcal{B}$$.
- $$P(\Omega) = 1$$
- If $$\{A_i\}_1^n$$ are disjoint set's then:
  $$P(\bigcup_{i}A_i) = \sum_i(A_i)$$ - finite additivity. (Countable additivity is already satisfied in the def. of a measure. Note that, countable additivity implies finite additivity).

This $$P$$ is known as a **probability measure.** Observe that, Event from the PT definition is now simply a measureable set.

<u>Measureable real valued function</u>$$f$$: If $$(X,\mathcal{M})$$ and ($$Y,\mathcal{N}$$) are measureable spaces, a mapping $$f: X \rightarrow Y$$ is called measureable if $$f^{-1} (E) \in \mathcal{M} \forall E \in \mathcal{M}$$. When $$f: X \rightarrow R$$, then it is called a measureable real valued function. This as seen in the table is the R.V equivalent.

Now let's use this notion and an example to rethink a few things. Say we have an experiment where we toss 3 fair coins simultaneously. Let our random variable $$V$$ denote the no. of heads in this experiment. Depending on the throw it can take on any of these 4 values i.e $$Val(V) = \{0,1,2,3\}$$. Therefore, there is a probability measure assosiated with this random variable. But how do we specify it? One way to specify it is to directly state the probability of each value this random variable can take, i.e $$P(V = v)$$. This is simply the Probability Mass Function.
Similarly, we can also define the CDF and PDF (for continous R.V's). Therefore, these functions are used to specify the probability measure assosiated with a random variable. Hence, they are not probabilities but rather representations of probability assosiated with a Random Variable.
