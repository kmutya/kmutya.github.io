This blog documents my exploration of Machine Learning and Optimization, theory first followed by some applied stuff. I started this blog during my Graduate Studies at TAMU to keep my thoughts in one place.

Apart from Math, I am also fascinated by Indian Philosphy particular questions relating to Atman (self), try to lead a sattvic lifestyle, maintain a low carbon footprint and quite contradictorily love strength training.
