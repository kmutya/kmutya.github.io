I like to use mathematics to solve ambigious open-ended problems. On paper, I have a Master's degree in Operations Research from the ISEN department at Texas A&M, College Station during which my focus was on Machine Learning and Mathematical Optimization.

At TAMU, I worked as a research assistant in the Human Factors and Machine Learning lab and developed deep learning based algorithms to detect Drowsy Driving. I also served a short stint at the Office of Scholarly Communication, TAMU Libraries where I worked on an NSF funded project to make some Statistical Inferences about researcher performance.

Amidst this, I also pursed a Co-Op at Tesla for 9 months where I worked on projects related to Machine Learning, Optimization and Statistical Data Analysis.

Apart from Math, I am also fascinated by Indian Philosphy particular questions relating to Atman (self), try to lead a sattvic lifestyle, maintain a low carbon footprint and quite contradictorily love strength training.
