I am currently pursuing a Master's degree in Operations Research and Analytics from the ISEN department at Texas A&M, College Station.
Previously, I interned at Tesla for about an year where I worked on projects related to Machine Learning, Mathematical Optimization, Statistical Modeling and Visualization.

During my Master's I worked as a research assistant in the Human Factors and Machine Learning lab at TAMU. My work was primarily focused on increasing classifier accuracy for Drowsy Driving Algorithms using Deep Learning. I also worked at the Office of Scholarly Communication at TAMU on an NSF funded project to make Statistical Inferences about researcher performance at TAMU.

My areas of interest are Time series forcasting/classification, Deep Learning, Statistical Modeling and Mathamatical Optimization.
