I am currently pursuing a Master's degree in Operations Research and Analytics from the ISEN department at Texas A&M, College Station.
Previously, I interned at Tesla for about an year where I worked on projects related to Probabilistic Modelling, Mathematical Optimization, Data Analysis and visualization.

During my Master's I worked as a research assistant in the Human Factors and Machine Learning lab at TAMU. My work was primarily focused on increasing classifier accuracy for Drowsy Driving Algorithms using Deep Learning. 

My areas of interest are Time series forcasting/classification, Deep Learning, Stochastic Modelling and Mathamatical Optimization.
