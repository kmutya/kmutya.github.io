In this article we look at the NP-hard maximum clique problem and solve it using a Linear Programming approach.
In particular, we reduce the clique problem to an Independent set problem and solve it by appying linear relaxation and column generation.

## Background

The clique problem arises in many real world settings. Most commonly in social networks which can be represented as a graph where the Vertices represent people and the graph's edges represent connections. Then a clique represents a subset of people who are all connected to each other. So by using clique related algorithms we can find more information regarding the connections. Along with this, the clique problem also has many applications in bioinformatics and computational chemistry.

An undirected graph has vertices that are connected together by undirected edges which we'll represent as G = (V, E) where V = $$\1,2, . . , n\}$$ and E $$\subseteq$$ V $$\times$$ V.
A clique is a subset of vertices C $$\subseteq$$ V in a graph such that there is an edge between any two vertices in the clique, \i,j}} $$\in$$ \E} for any \i,j} $$\in$$ \C}.
An independent set is a subset of vertices C $$\subseteq$$ V in a graph such that there is no edge between any two vertices in the independent set, i,j $$\notin$$ E for any i,j $$\in$$ C.

 A clique (independent set) is called maximal if it is not a subset of a larger clique (independent set) in G, and maximum if there is no larger clique (independent set) in G. The cardinality of a of a maximum clique in G is denoted $$\omega$$ G and is called the clique number of G. It is also known as the fractional clique number.
